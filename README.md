## A LaTeX class module for GDD and technical projects.
This is WIP and was created for my personal use.
I will regularly modify and extend this class, and maybe create more packages if needed.

Anyone interested, feel free to use or modify this class for your sake.

## coda-common
The *coda-common* document class is intended to maximize content per page and persist a minimal aesthetic.
It should support heavy use of floats, source code listings and page layout changes.
Its' purpose are note taking, research or GDDs.
